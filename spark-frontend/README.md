# 🗻 Spark

Spark is a web application that allows event providers to host their events and for consumers to join the events. 

The MVP version of the application, including the backend API (refer to API reference section) and the frontend UI, has taken 2 weeks to develop during my studies in Code Chrysalis.

## Motivation

Motivation behind developing this project is the wish to have a portal that invites event hosts, primarily smaller-scale business owners and cultural tourism related providers, to host events in this platform.
