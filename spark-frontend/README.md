# ðŸ—»Â Spark

Spark is a web application that allows event providers to host their events and for consumers to join the events.

The MVP version of the application, including the backend API (refer to API reference section) and the frontend UI, has taken 2 weeks to develop during my studies in Code Chrysalis.

Currently, the app is under continuously development.

Documentation of implementation coming soon.
